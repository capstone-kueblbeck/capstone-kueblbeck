## Introduction
This project is an analysis of the stock management of spare parts for the spare parts dealer K端blbeck.<br> 
Our target is the examination and optimization for inventory management of the German locations. 
<br></br>
The aim is to exchange already existing parts between the locations according to current sales figures and thus to minimize both the storage capacities and the procurement of new parts. <br> 
Indicators for an exchange are the number of stored products per location, the corresponding sales figures per location as well as a location analysis.
<br></br>
In a second step, these data analyses are to be made available to the K端blbeck company in a dashboard or python script which can continue to be used and expanded internally even after the project has been completed.
